            Arithmetic Operators
            Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations:

            Operator	Name	            Description	Example	Try it
                +	    Addition	        Adds together two values	x + y	
                -	    Subtraction     	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
                *	    Multiplication      Multiplies two values	x * y	
                /	    Division        	Divides one value by another	x / y	
                %	    Modulus     	    Returns the division remainder	x % y	
                ++	    Increment       	Increases the value of a variable by 1	x++	
                --	    Decrement       	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	x--
